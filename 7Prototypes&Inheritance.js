/*
-- Prototypes and Prototypal Inheritance --
-What are Prototypes?
-In JavaScript, every object has an internal link to another object called its prototype.
-This prototype object can have its own prototype, creating a chain known as the prototype chain.
-The chain ends when an object has a null prototype.
